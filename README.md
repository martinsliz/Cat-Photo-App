### Description
Part of the Responsive Web Design Certification with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), this mini project is to work on and strengthen HTML skills

#### Challenges:
I got stuck creating a radio button and adding text, then I realized that I was over complicating it when all it needed was text beside it

### Goals:

To come back and style it a bit w/ CSS

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - When I want a user-friendly explanation of coding concepts, this is where I head first.
